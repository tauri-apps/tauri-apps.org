## Donations and Sponsoring

>At the moment the best way to support the development of Tauri is to visit our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/tauri) page and make a donation. Funds go first and foremost to covering the overhead of the project, additional funds will be distributed to all contributors using a sourcecred-based system. Thanks for consideration! :heart:
If you are interested in sponsoring Tauri and want to accelerate the development of specific components, we encourage you to reach out to the team.
