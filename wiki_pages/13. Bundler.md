# Bundler

The Tauri Bundler is a rust harness for compiling your binary, packaging assets and preparing a final bundle.

It will detect your operating system and build a bundle accordingly. It currently supports:

- Linux: .deb, .appimage
- MacOS: .app (.dmg coming soon)
- Windows: .exe, .msi

## anti-bloat features

### Rust Compression features
add this to your `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

    [profile.release]
    panic = "abort"
    codegen-units = 1
    lto = true
    incremental = false
    opt-level = "z"


### upx
UPX, **Ultimate Packer for eXecutables**, is a dinosaur amongst the binary packers. This 23-year old, well-maintained piece of kit is GPL-v2 licensed with a pretty liberal usage declaration. Our understanding of the licensing is that you can use it for any purposes (commercial or otherwise) without needing to change your license unless you modify the source code of UPX.

 Basically it compresses the binary and decompresses it at runtime. It should work for pretty much any binary type out there. Read more: https://github.com/upx/upx

> You should know that this technique might flag your binary as a virus on Windows and MacOS - so use at your own discretion, and as always validate with Frida and do real distribution testing!

#### Usage on MacOS
    $ brew install upx
    $ yarn tauri build
    $ upx --ultra-brute src-tauri/target/release/bundle/osx/app.app/Contents/MacOS/app
