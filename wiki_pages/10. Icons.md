# Icons

Tauri ships with an iconset based on its logo. This is probably NOT what you want when you ship your app. To rememdy this common situation, there is a nodejs script that will take an input file and create all the icons needed for the various platforms and by default place them in your `src-tauri/icons` folder.

```
local:  yarn tauri icon
global: tauri icon
```

```
Options
  --help, -h          Displays this message
  --log, l            Logging [boolean]
  --icon, i           Source icon (png, 1240x1240 with transparency)
  --target, t         Target folder (default: 'src-tauri/icons')
  --compression, c    Compression type [pngquant|optipng|zopfli]
```

Should you however, need to source your icons from some other location, you can edit this part of the `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` file:

```
[package.metadata.bundle]
icon = [
  "icons/32x32.png",
  "icons/128x128.png",
  "icons/128x128@2x.png",
  "icons/icon.icns",
  "icons/icon.ico"
]
```

## Notes on filetypes:
- icon.icns = MacOS
- icon.ico = MS Windows
- *.png = Linux
