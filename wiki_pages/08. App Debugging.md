# Debugging
With all the moving pieces in tauri, you may need to investigate what is happening - or going wrong. There are several consoles that will help you discover what's going on where and give you insight into what is going wrong.

## Rust Console
When you run a tauri app (except when it has been bundled and you are running that bundle) you will have a rust console available. This is in the terminal where you ran e.g. `tauri dev`. You can use the following code to print something to that console from within a rust file:
```
println!("Message from rust: {}", msg);
```

Sometimes you may have an error in your rust code, and the rust compiler can give you lots of information. If, for example, `tauri dev` crashes, you can rerun it like this on Linux and MacOS:
```
RUST_DEBUG=1 tauri dev
```
or like this on MS Windows:
```
set RUST_DEBUG=1
tauri dev
```

This will give you a granular stack trace. Generally speaking, the rust compiler will help you by
giving you detailed information about the issue, such as:

```
For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0433`
```

## Webview JS Console
### Linux & MacOS
Right click in the webview, and choose `Inspect Element`. This will open up a web-inspector, as you are used to seeing and using it.
### Windows
If you enable the Edge backend (web-view = { version = "*", features = ["edge"] } in Cargo.toml) you can use the standalone Edge DevTools app.

This enables you to connect the dev tools to your Rust-backed web view as if it were a normal Edge window. (Thanks to @dkaste for providing the solution [in this issue](https://github.com/Boscop/web-view/issues/88#issuecomment-552464137).

If you are using MSHTML, then you will probably have to use firebug:
```
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite.js"></script>
```
See [this thread](https://github.com/zserge/webview/blob/master/README.md#debugging-and-development-tips) for more information.

## Create a debugging BUILD
There are cases where you might need to inspect the JS console in the final bundle, so tauri provides a simple command to create a debugging bundle:

```
local:  yarn tauri build --debug
global: tauri build --debug
```

Like the normal build and dev processes, the first time you run this it will take more time than subsequent runs. However, the final bundled app will be placed in `src-tauri/target/debug/bundle`. That app will ship with the development console enabled.

## Run your app from the terminal
You can also run a built app from the terminal, which will also give you the rust compiler notes (in case of errors) or your `println` messages. Just find the file `src-tauri/target/release/app` and either double click it (but be warned, the terminal will close on errors) or just run it in directly in your console.
