# MS Windows Setup
This setup is only needed for development. Consumers of Tauri apps will not have to do any of this.

## Dependencies
Tauri is a polyglot system, and as such requires a good deal of tooling.

### System dependencies:

First you should [download](https://aka.ms/buildtools) and install Visual Studio MSBuild Tools and C++ build tools.

> This is a big download (over 1GB) and takes the most time, so go grab a :coffee:

Chocolatey is a great package manager for Windows. Follow these [these official instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install), or just do this:

Then download and install [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
Then install Chocolatey

```powershell
# BE SURE YOU ARE IN AN ADMINISTRATIVE PowerShell!
nvm install 12
nvm use 12
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco install yarn
```


### Node runtime and package manager
We recommend using NVM to manage your node runtime. It allows you to easily switch versions and update.
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```
> We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere [download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh)

Once nvm is installed (you may have to use another terminal), then install Node 12LTS and the latest NPM:
```
nvm install 12LTS
```
If you have any problems with NVM, please consult their [project readme](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Now that `npm` is installed, if you like you may additionally install `yarn` - the preferred package manager of the Tauri team.

```
npm install --global yarn
```


### Rustc and Cargo package manager
If you are running Windows 64-bit, download and run [rustup‑init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) and then follow the onscreen instructions.

If you are running Windows 32-bit, download and run [rustup‑init.exe](https://win.rustup.rs/i686) and then follow the onscreen instructions.

```
$ rustup update stable
$ rustup override set 1.40.0
```

### Enable loopback
Microsoft disables the loopback interface - you need to whitelist it if you intend to use the dev-server:

Open an administrative console and enter:
```
CheckNetIsolation.exe LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.Win32WebViewHost_cw5n1h2txyewy"
```

### Devtools
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide

## Tauri bundler
After you have installed Rust and the build toolchain, it is wise to open a new shell before continuing.

Setup the bundler:

```
$ cargo install tauri-cli --force
```
