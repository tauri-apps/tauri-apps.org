# Tauri Documentation
This wiki documentation is a WIP, and will be transferred to a dedicated documentation site **in the very near future**.™️ Our decision to use the wiki format was made in order to enable the working groups to rapidly iterate on the contents.

If you find an error and would like to propose an improvement, you have several options:
1. Open an issue.
2. Visit our [discord server](https://discord.gg/SpmNs4S) and raise your concern.
3. Request to join one of the working groups to gain access (on Discord).

## Audience
It is primarily written from the perspective of enabling contributors to understand how Tauri works under the hood. Nevertheless, it should also be instructive for anyone interested in implementing Tauri in their own projects.
