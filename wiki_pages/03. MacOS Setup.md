# MacOS Setup
This setup is only needed for development. Consumers of Tauri apps will not have to do any of this.

## Dependencies
Tauri is a polyglot system, and as such requires a good deal of tooling.

### System dependencies:
```
$ brew install gcc
```

### Node runtime and package manager
We recommend using NVM to manage your node runtime. It allows you to easily switch versions and update.
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```
> We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere [download link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh)

Once nvm is installed (you may have to use another terminal), then install Node 12LTS and the latest NPM:
```
nvm install 12
nvm use 12
```

If you have any problems with NVM, please consult their [project readme](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Now that `npm` is installed, if you like you may additionally install `yarn` - the preferred package manager of the Tauri team.

```
npm install --global yarn
```


### Rustc and Cargo package manager
```
$ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
> We have audited this bash script, and it does what it says it is supposed to do. Nevertheless, before blindly curl-bashing a script, it is always wise to look at it first. Here is the file as a mere [download link](https://sh.rustup.rs).

Make sure that `rustc` and `cargo` are in your $PATH. Run

```
$ rustc --version
latest update on 2019-12-19, rust version 1.40.0
```
and make sure you are on latest update on 2019-12-19, rust version 1.40.0 - otherwise be sure to update.

```
$ rustup update stable
$ rustup override set 1.40.0
```

### Tauri Bundler
After you have installed Rust and the build toolchain, you may need to open a new shell before continuing.

Install the bundler:

```
$ cargo install tauri-cli --force
```
